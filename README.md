-> This is a simple project that allows users to register their details. The registered information is stored in a database and can be viewed by users in a datatable. 
-> Validation is implemented to ensure the accuracy of user details during the registration process. 
-> It's important to note that this project focuses solely on user registration and does not include a login system. In a future project, I plan to develop a comprehensive registration and login system
